<!-- This is the greatest and best repo in the world...
Tribute...
Long time ago me and my brother Kyle here
We was hitchhiking down a long and lonesome road.
All of a sudden
There shined a shiny demon
In the middle of the road
And he said!
Play the best song in the world, or I'll eat your souls... (souls)
Well me and Kyle
We looked at each other
And we each said
Okay.
And we played the first thing that came to our heads
Just so happened to be
The best song in the world
It was the best song in the world.
Look into my eyes and it's easy to see
One and one makes two, two and one makes three
It was destiny.
Once every hundred thousand years or so
When the sun doth shine
And the moon doth glow and the grass doth grow.
Needless to say
The beast was stunned.
Whip-crack went his whoopy tail
And the beast was done.
He asked us
Be you angels?
And we said nay
We are but men
Rock!
Ah, ah, ah, oh, wo, a-yo!
This is not the greatest song in the world, no.
This is just a tribute!
Couldn't remember the greatest song in the world, yeah - no!
This is a tribute!
To the greatest song in the world
Alright!
It was the greatest song in the world
Alright!
This is the best motherfuckin' song, the greatest song in the world all right!!
(A capella)...lucifer...
And the peculiar thing is this my friends
The song we sang on that fateful night
It didn't actually sound anything like this song!
This is just a tribute!
You gotta believe me
And I wish you were there
Just a matter of opinion.
And ohh what the fuck!
Good God
Gotta love him
I'm so surprised to find you can't stop me now
The fiery ring of fire
Rittsss mother-fucking the greatest song
Alright!
Alright! -->
So there we are, I've updated the ReadMe file, on this branch (I think), created a pull request and committed, there can't be much more to it other than practice, right?
